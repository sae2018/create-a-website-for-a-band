# Stephen Elcombe - User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project - Create a website for a band

This project is to create a website for The Monkees, a 60's rock/pop group. It fulfils the needs stated in the client's brief that fans should be able to see new material, view photos, view videos, listen to audio and be able to book the band for functions.

 
## UX
 
I designed this website to make it easy and intuitive for fans to access the latest content and back catalogue of The Monkees. Fans would like to view and download photos and videos and listen to songs by the band. I have made these assets available in an easy to understand way on separate pages. My original wireframe is available at https://create-a-website-for-a-band-sae2018.c9users.io/wireframe.png.

- As a fan of the band, I want to view or download photos, so that I can see photos of the band or download them to their device.
- As a fan of the band, I want to view or download videos, so that I can watch videos of the band or download them to their device.
- As a fan of the band, I want to listen to or download songs, so that I can hear music from the band or download them to their device.
- As a fan of the band, I want to book them for my function, so that they can perform live at an event.
- As a fan of the band, I want to connect with the band on social media to keep up to date with the latest information.


## Features

New Material - This is displayed on the homepage. In order to show the new material from the band on the website I have asked permission to use the graphics from the official Monkees website, but as of today 10/10/18 I am still waiting to see if permission has been granted to me to use the images from their new material, as this was obviously not contained within the resources given for the project.

Bookings - A page detailing how to book the band for functions, examples of what sort of functions they may be able to attend and a contact form, in order to make an enquiry about whether the band would be available for a specific event.

Photos and Videos - A page listing the photos and videos made available to me from the resources section of the project. This has been created in an easily usable and readable format so that it is easy to view and download the required content.

Songs - A page with a playable list of songs from the resources section of the project. This has also been created in an easy to understand, listen and download format, for ease of use by anyone.

Social Media - The ability to connect with the band via various social media platforms

 
### Existing Features
- New material would allow site visitors to see the band's new material and download or buy it, if a client instructed me to add that functionality
- Photos, videos and songs can be viewed or downloaded
- Bookings and enquiries for functions can be made from a specific page
- Social media icons linking to official band social media accounts


### Features Left to Implement
- Future features that could be added include linking new material on the homepage with purchasing of albums, tickets etc. Additional information about the band and the band members could also be added on another page.


## Technologies Used

The website makes use of:
- [HTML5](https://www.w3.org)
    - This project uses **HTML5** as the base code.
- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org)
    - This project uses **CSS3** to style the page layout.
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
    - This project uses **Bootstrap** to structure the page layout.
- [Cloud9](https://ide.c9.io)
    - This project uses **Cloud9** to edit and host the files and code.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
    - This project uses **Git** for version control
- [GitHub](https://github.com)
    - This project uses **GitHub** for version publishing

I have also used the following websites as references for code or content:
- [W3 Schools](www.w3schools.com)
    - This project used **W3 Schools** to reference semantic code.
- [Font Awesome](www.fontawesome.com)
    - This project used **Font Awesome** to get graphical images.
- [hover.css](http://ianlunn.github.io/Hover/)
    - This project used **hover.css** to create transitions on the navigation menu.
- [Wikipedia](www.wikipedia.org)
    - This project used **Wikipedia** for information about the band and its members


## Testing

I have been through the whole site and tested every link on every page to ensure they all work as expected.

To test my site's validity I used:
HTML5: https://validator.w3.org/nu/
CSS3: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Bookings" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Please note: The form on this page will not submit, as we have not yet been taught how to do that

2. Photos:
    1. Go to the "Photos and Videos" page
    2. Left click on one of the thumbnail photos or the photo name and verify that the photo loads full-size into a new browser window
    3. Right click on the image to confirm that you can copy or save the photo

3. Videos:
    1. Go to the "Photos and Videos" page
    2. Confirm that the video plays automatically (in some browsers) or click the play button to start it
    3. Left click on the three dots to confirm that the video can be downloaded

4. Songs:
    1. Go to the "Songs" page
    2. Left click play on one of the audio file sliders and verify that the music starts
    3. Left click on the song name to verify that the audio clip can be loaded into a new tab
    4. Left click on the three dots to confirm that the audio file can be downloaded


The website has been tested with all the major browsers and remains stable on all versions in all sizes. In order for this to happen I have used semantic structured code and utilised the browser specific CSS3 code for transitions on the transitions.

There were some issues with the code on some of the pages during creation and testing, such as not stacking properly in different screen sizes and transitions not working as expected, but these problems have been solved with a little research beyond what we have been taught so far.


## Deployment

Differences between the deployed version and the development version:
- The version of the website held on C9 (development version) is identical to the GitHub (deployed version)
- All files are identical on both servers
- All GitHub files are stored under the master branch


## Credits
Thanks for their help when I got stuck go to the Code Institute Tutor Team and to my mentor who went through my work before submission. I would also like to thank the websites whose resources I used both when I was stuck and for website functionality, as listed in the ## Technologies Used section above.

### Content
- The 'About Us' text for the footer was copied from the [Wikipedia article The Monkees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkees)


### Media
- The photos, videos and audio used in this site were obtained from the resources section for the project. In order to use the images of new material on the homepage I sought permission from The Monkees official website, but as at today 11/10/18 I have not yet heard whether I have permission to use these images or not, and therefore have a placeholder image to show where they would go.


### Acknowledgements

- I received inspiration for this project from previous project work taught on the course.
